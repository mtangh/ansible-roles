      ### forwarding rule ###
      The following statement defines a SINGLE forwarding rule.
      They belong together, do NOT split them. If you create multiple
      forwarding rules, duplicate the whole block!
      Remote Logging (we use TCP for reliable delivery)
      #
      remote host is: name/ip:port, e.g. 192.168.0.1:514, port optional
